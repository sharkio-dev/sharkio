# API Debugging 101

Learn how to debug your APIs using Sharkio.

---

Sharkio allows you to debug your APIs by providing a simple way to inspect the request and response data. Furthermore, you can also modify the request and response data to test your APIs.


## Requests Panel

The requests panel shows the request data sent to the server and its response. It shows the request method, URL, headers, and body. You can also modify the request data to test your APIs.
You are also able to filter the requests by various criteria such as the request method, URL, and status code.

## Execute Request

By clicking on the "Play" button, you can execute the request and view the response data. You can also modify the request data to test your APIs.

## Mocking Request

By clicking on the yellow "Mock" button, you can mock the request's response with a single click. This will activate a mock that will intercept the request and return the mocked response. You can also modify the mocked response later and add more mocks. checkout the mocking section for more details.
